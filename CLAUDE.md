# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current state

This project has **no source code yet**. The only content is `examples/`, a reference
implementation checked out for study. There is nothing to build, lint, or test.

`cosmic-wallpaper-applet/` is an untracked directory inside the larger
`/home/ercling/workspace/tests` git repo — it has no git history of its own and is not
yet committed. Decide with the user whether this becomes its own repo before running
`git init` or committing here.

When real code lands, replace this section with the actual build/test/run commands and
the applet's architecture.

## examples/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension

An independent clone of `git@github.com:neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension` (version 53)
with its own `.git` directory. **Reference material only — do not modify it, and do not
expect changes here to be tracked by the parent repo.** It is a GJS/GNOME Shell extension
(not COSMIC), so treat it as a source of behavioral patterns rather than code to port.

The patterns worth reading before designing the equivalent COSMIC applet:

- `utils.js` — the data layer. Bing's image-of-the-day is fetched from
  `https://www.bing.com/HPImageArchive.aspx?format=js&n=8`; the downloaded image
  catalogue is persisted as JSON in a GSettings key and manipulated by pure helpers
  (`getImageList` / `setImageList` / `mergeImageLists`, favourite and hidden flags,
  `dateFromLongDate` for Bing's `YYYYMMDDHHMM` timestamps).
- `extension.js` — the panel indicator (`BingWallpaperIndicator`), and all of the
  scheduling logic. Note the two independent timers: `_restartTimeout` (refresh, driven
  off Bing's own update time, backing off to `TIMEOUT_SECONDS_ON_HTTP_ERROR` = 1h on HTTP
  failure) and `_restartShuffleTimeout` (rotate the wallpaper from already-downloaded
  images). Wallpaper is applied by writing `picture-uri` into the
  `org.gnome.desktop.background` schema — this is the part with no COSMIC analogue and
  will need `cosmic-bg` config instead.
- `prefs.js` + `ui/prefsadw.ui` + `schemas/*.gschema.xml` — settings are declared once in
  the GSettings schema and bound to a libadwaita UI file.

Its own commands (run from inside that directory, only if you need to exercise the
reference):

```bash
npm run lint          # eslint *.js
./buildzip.sh         # compile schemas + gettext catalogues, produce the extension zip
./install.sh          # buildzip, unzip into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions, enable
```
